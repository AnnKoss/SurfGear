# Contributing rules

Thank you for your interest in promoting the development of our software product. Before getting to
work, we ask to familiarise with some agreements that will help our productive cooperation. 

## Pull request rules: 

To apply your changes in the codebase you have to create a pull request. When creating a pull
request, there are several things that you should do to help ensure that your pull request is accepted: 

1.	The code does not contain analyzer errors. 
2.	The code follows a common style. 
3.	The code contains no error. 
4.	The code is formatted. 
5.	New functionality is covered by tests. 
6.	New functionality passes old tests. 
7.	There is a demonstration example, showing how the new functionality works. 
8.	A new public API is described in the documentation. 
9.	If new functionality contains work with graphics (animation, transitions, swipes), 
it is necessary to make screen recording and append link in the pull request description. 

## Code review rules  

After you create a pull request, we will review your changes. Code review is necessary for detecting
errors, consider solutions from different points of view and sharing knowledge. Reviewers
are developers, who were responsible for creating module. During the code review,
developers can ask questions about different parts of code, detect errors, syntax issues.
For every question will be created comments expressing that something could be better or something
is needed to be discussed. After solving all issues and finishing the review, we will introduce your
changes in the required branch.

green button «Merge pull request” in the GitHub interface and apply your changes.
