## Pull request rules

Make sure that your code:

4.	Is formatted. 
5.	New functionality is covered by tests. New functionality passes old tests. 
6.	Create example that demonstrate new functionality if it is possible
7.	A new public API is described in the documentation. If new functionality contains work with
    graphics (animation, transitions, swipes), it is necessary to make screen recording and append 
    link to it in the pull request description.
