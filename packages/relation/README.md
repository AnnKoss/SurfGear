## About
This package provides the ability to associate user actions with application state.
## Currently supported features
- Action - It's wrapper over an action on screen.
It may be a tap on button, text changes, focus changes and so on.
- StreamedState - A state of some type wrapped in a stream
dictates the widget's state
- EntityStreamedState - A state that have download/error/content status
## Usage
### Initialization
First you need to initialize Action and StreamedState
```dart 
 final incrementAction = Action();
 final incrementState = StreamedState<int>();
 
 final reloadAction = Action();
 final loadDataState = EntityStreamedState<int>();
```
During initialization, for StreamedState and EntityStreamedState, you can set initial values that will be displayed when the widget is initialized.
```dart
final incrementState = r.StreamedState<int>(0);
final loadDataState = r.EntityStreamedState<int>(r.EntityState(isLoading: true));
```
### Action binding
After initialization, you should bind the methods that will be executed upon performing any actions

```dart
    incrementAction.stream.listen(
      (_) => increment()
    );

    reloadAction.stream.listen((_) => _load());
```
### State management
When a user performs an action, it entails a change in the state of the program.
```dart
Future increment() async {
    return incrementState.accept(incrementState.value + 1);
}

Future _load() async {
    await loadDataState.loading();
    var result = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2),() =>DateTime.now().second,);
await loadDataState.content(await result);
}
```
- StreamedState contain any data type.
- EntityStreamedState, in addition to storing data, also contains 3 standard states
    - loading - load data 
    - error - error of load
    - data - data load success

These states can help you design your implementation of a responsive interface.

### Update UI
To listen for changes happening in StreamedState and EntityStreamedState use the EntityStateBuilder:

```dart
StreamedStateBuilder(
streamedState: incrementState,
builder: (ctx, count) => Text('number of count: $count'),
)
```
StreamedStateBuilder also supports receiving states _loading_, _error_ and _data_
```dart
EntityStateBuilder<int>(
streamedState: loadDataState,
child: (ctx, data) => Text('success load: $data'),
loadingChild: CircularProgressIndicator(),
errorChild: Text('sorry - error, try again'),
),
```
## Additional States
To listen for text actions use TextEditingAction
```dart
final textAction = r.TextEditingAction();
...
textAction.stream.listen((event) {
    print("typed $event");
});
...
TextField(
    controller: textAction.controller,
    onChanged: textAction,
),
```
Use TextFieldStateBuilder to update ui
```dart
TextFieldStateBuilder(
        state: testData,
        stateBuilder: (context, data) {
        return Text('test');
}),  
```
To track the scroll offset use ScrollOffsetAction
```dart
final scrollAction = r.ScrollOffsetAction();
...
scrollAction.stream.listen((event) {
      print("scroll offset $event");
});
...
TextField(
    controller: textAction.controller,
    onChanged: textAction,
),
...
SingleChildScrollView(
    controller: scrollAction.controller,
)
```
